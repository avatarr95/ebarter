<h1> eBarter.io - an OLX for barter transactions </h1>
<b> This project has been awarded by Venture Cafe Warsaw during #ideaHack Hackaton by Venture Cafe Warsaw and Oracle. </b>

The settings.py file has been removed, since there were dependencies that had to be added to connect the project to Oracle Database. However, it is recommended to run this project with PostgreSQL database.
